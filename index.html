                        Blood is the fluid that circulates throughout our body conducting various functions. There are
                        times when a person loses excessive blood and needs blood from some external source. In such
                        situations, the donation of blood plays an important role. It is the noblest cause you can do to
                        help ailing people. Blood Donation is the process wherein blood is drawn from one person and
                        transfused to another person. Blood banks usually engage in this collection process and
                        procedures following it. World Blood Donor Day is celebrated on 14th June every year.
                    </p>
                    <h1 class="heading">Types of Blood Groups</h1>
                    <p>There are mainly four types of blood groups: A, B, AB, and O. Negative O blood group is the
                        universal donor and AB positive is the universal recipient.</p>
                    <h1 class="heading">Benefits of Blood Donation</h1>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Preserve Cardiovascular Health: Reducing iron in the blood cells can reduce the risk of heart
                            attacks and strokes through blood donation. Research says if participants between the age group
                            of 43 and 61 donate blood every six months then they are at a lower risk of getting heart
                            attacks and strokes</li>
                        <li> Reduce the Risk of Cancer: The risk of cancer such as liver, lung, colon, and throat cancers can
                            be reduced by consistent blood donation. This is because the iron stored in the body is
                            maintained at a healthy level.</li>
                        <li>Burn Calories: According to the university of the United States of America, you can burn 650
                            calories approximately per donation of one pint of blood.</li>
                        <li>  Free Blood Analysis: Every donor has to go through a physical test to analyze whether they are
                            eligible to donate blood. This preliminary health checkup helps in diagnosing our own body like
                            pressure level, hemoglobin, and iron and sugar level. It is also tested for HIV, hepatitis, and
                            other diseases.</li>
                        <li>        A Sense of Pride: While there are many physical benefits of donating blood, the most powerful
                            health benefit is psychological. When you know that the blood that you are donating will be used
                            somewhere to save someone's life, it gives you a sense of immense pride.</li>
                        <li> Blood Bank: Blood donation helps the blood banks to stabilize the various groups of blood that
                            can be used to treat patients who are in urgent need of blood transfusion and other medical
                            treatments</li>
                    </ul>
