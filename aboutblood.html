                    <p>Blood is the fluid that transports oxygen and nutrients around the body. An average adult has
                        just under 5
                        litres of blood circulating around their body.

                        Blood is made up of the following four major components:

                        Red blood cells their main role is to transport oxygen
                        White blood cells - the cells of the immune system which defend the body against infections
                        Platelets - important for blood clotting and tissue repair
                        Plasma - the liquid part of the blood which carries the blood cells and other substances around
                        the body</p>

                    <h1 class="heading">About Blood Donations</h1>
                    <p>Approximately one in 30 people in the Australian community donate blood.
                        A blood donor can provide a whole blood donation, or can donate only the plasma or platelet
                        component of
                        their blood
                        through a process known as apheresis. See the Australian Red Cross Lifeblood(link is external)
                        website for
                        more detail
                        about donating blood</p>

                    <h1 class="heading">About Blood Products</h1>
                    <p>As illustrated in the diagram above, blood donations collected are separated into components so
                        that they can
                        be supplied to meet clinical need. The following are the major Fresh Blood Products:

                        Red blood cells
                        Platelets
                        Plasma components:
                        Clinical fresh frozen plasma
                        Cryo-depleted plasma
                        Cryoprecipitate
                        Plasma is also used to manufacture other products. Proteins can be isolated from plasma by
                        fractionation
                        processes,
                        and can be made into products to treat specific diseases. For example, clotting factors such as
                        Factor VIII
                        and Factor
                        IX are used to treat haemophilia A and B respectively. Immunoglobulins (Ig) are used by the body
                        to protect
                        against
                        infections. Intravenous (IV) delivery of immunoglobulin (IVIg) is used to replace and/or
                        modulate a person's
                        immune
                        response in a wide range of conditions, such as primary immunodeficiency and chronic
                        inflammatory
                        demyelinating
                        polyneuropathy. Visit Plasma and Recombinant Products for more information on fractionated
                        plasma products
                        and their use.

                        Some blood products are manufactured from non-human components using genetic engineering. These
                        are called
                        recombinant
                        products and are alternatives to some fractionated plasma products. For example, recombinant
                        clotting
                        factors are
                        increasingly used in place of plasma-derived clotting products to treat people with haemophilia.
                        Visit
                        Plasma and
                        Recombinant Products for more information on recombinant products and their use.</p>
